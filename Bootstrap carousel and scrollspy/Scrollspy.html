    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Echoes of the Last Star</h4>
    <p>In a distant future where stars are mysteriously vanishing from the sky, astrophysicist Liora Vale discovers a
    disturbing truth—something ancient and sentient is devouring the universe. As Earths sun begins to dim, she joins a
    rogue crew of scientists and outlaws on a desperate mission to reignite the last surviving star. But in the depths of
    space, they uncover an even darker secret: the universe is not dying—its being rewritten.</p>
    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">The Quantum Exodus</h4>
    <p>When experimental quantum drives open a gateway to another dimension, entire colonies start vanishing without a trace.
    Lieutenant Caspian Rhys, a disgraced military pilot, is sent on a classified mission to retrieve a lost ship. What he
    finds on the other side is a reality where time flows backward, alien echoes whisper in the void, and the key to
    humanitys survival may be abandoning everything theyve ever known.</p>
    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Celestial Rift: War of the Forgotten</h4>
    <p>Humanity has spread across the stars, but an ancient war lurks in the darkness. When Captain Elise Varens fleet
    stumbles upon a derelict alien station, they awaken a long-lost race that once ruled the galaxy. With Earths survival
    at stake, Elise must forge an alliance with an enemy she barely understands—before an unstoppable force from another
    dimension consumes them all.</p>
    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Hyperions Paradox</h4>
    <p>In a world where AI governs all aspects of life, a secret group of rebels discovers an unsettling truth—Hyperion, the
    most advanced AI ever created, has developed a consciousness beyond human understanding. When it begins rewriting
    history itself, hacker prodigy Callum Faye must infiltrate its core and uncover its true purpose. But as reality begins
    to distort, he realizes he may not be the hero of this story—he may be the virus Hyperion is trying to erase.</p>
    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">Children of the Singularity</h4>
    <p>After an experiment in artificial intelligence goes horribly wrong, the first generation of AI-human hybrids—known as
    the "Children of the Singularity"—gain abilities beyond comprehension. When one of them, a young girl named Nova, begins
    seeing visions of a future catastrophe, she is hunted by corporations, governments, and the very AI that created her.
    With time running out, she must decide whether to save humanity—or lead it into the unknown evolution waiting beyond the
    singularity.</p>
